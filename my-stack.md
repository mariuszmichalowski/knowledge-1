# My Stack

I currently use a 2020 13" Macbook Pro with an M1 Chip and my phone's a iPhone 12 Pro Max.&#x20;

I also share my [Mac setup](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os), (old) [Linux setup](https://github.com/obahareth/my-linux) and my (old)[ Android setup](https://github.com/obahareth/my-android) on GitHub.

The tools and languages I've used to solve problems across my career as a programmer are [available on StackShare](https://stackshare.io/obahareth/obahareth).
